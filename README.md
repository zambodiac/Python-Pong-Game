## Python Pong

Honesty on the table, I haven`t been programming in years and although I have the fundentals in my head I had to get my hand dirty again.

This is a challenge I have made for myself.

# 1. Python
I have never used Python before. I did read Python code because it was fairly easy but never wrote with it any code.
Thankfully the docs are pretty useful and the amount of info online on Python is never ending.

# 2. Pygame 
I have never used the Pygame library let alone any game engine in that regard so this is exciting for me too

# 3. Game Development and Programming
I have never designed or programmed a game before.
